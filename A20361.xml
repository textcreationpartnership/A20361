            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

witne≈ø≈øe. Great, ≈øure was the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of this a≈ø≈øemblye and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ference. And not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out cau≈øe. For neuer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fore in Fraunce were we

which were dryuen thereto for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo≈øt part agayn≈øt there willes, &amp;

For they woulde alwayes, either haue vs put to ≈øylence, oure mouthes

But we coulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get them together withoute great entreatye, or continuall

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11319:5"/>For at the la≈øte, the matter was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fiue

an other, whereby, as wel the Bi≈øhops, as other nobles of the realme, were
commaunded to repayre to Poy≈ø≈øye, to deliberate, both for the leauyeng of a
tribute, to di≈øcharge the kynges dettes to foren Princes, but chefely for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
reforming of the e≈øtate of religion. Therby al≈øo, the kinges peace and
≈øafecondwite was graunted to all ≈øuche as woulde come thither, freely to

that quietly, and freely, they myght mete together, without trouble or

or for mariage: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where, than in the Churches, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any other

to the king, which then lay at Saynt Germans, nye to <pb facs="tcp:11319:12"/> Poy≈ø≈øye.

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fe≈ø≈øion of that faith, which they profe≈ø≈øed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues ready to

            <p>Fir≈øt, that no Bi≈øhops, nor others of the eccle≈øia≈øticall

            <p>Secondly, that the king, Queene, and nobilitie, ≈øhould rule the

and ≈øtrif, all matters myght be handeled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that al controuer≈øies might be tryed by the worde of

               <pb facs="tcp:11319:12"/> onely, all our fayth and religion ought to be
grounded.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that certayne notaryes and Scribes, ≈øhould be cho≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
of eyther part which might faithfully regi≈øter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer wer done or
decreed. Who≈øe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ≈øhould be of no credite, vnle≈ø≈øe they were
allowed, and confe≈ø≈øed of either part. The≈øe reque≈øtes no man
mi≈øliked And the kyng an≈øwered, that he would take thadui≈øe of his
councell, and by his Chauncelour ≈øhortly make them an an≈øwere: yet
the≈øame was long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Bicau≈øe the matter was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the
Bi≈øhops, without who≈øe councel, or knowledge to do any thing, it ≈øemed
not mete. For, not only for thys matter of religion, had the kyng a≈ø≈øembled
them, but al≈øo, for the leauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of mony, to di≈øcharge hys dettes. They
waxing proude wyth thys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydence, that the kyng ≈øemed to nede their aide:
a≈ø≈øured them≈øelues, of the obtayning of any thyng agayn≈øte vs, nothyng
doutyng the a≈ø≈øured conque≈øt of Ladye money. Furthermore, they tryfled
and prolonged the tyme, <pb facs="tcp:11319:13"/> ≈øeeking al occa≈øions, to auoide our
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and di≈øputation. For they ≈øayd we were already condemned and
that they might not di≈øpute with heretykes. The≈øe, and ≈øuch other like,
their accu≈øto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med ≈øtayes, they began to bla≈øe, whiche neuerthele≈ø≈øe,

were a≈øhamed openly to refu≈øe our conference, ≈øith by their own

Which ≈øome thought in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prologe, or preamble, of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
≈øhould en≈øue: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hereby me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> may know, what credite they ought to geue to
≈øuch rumors as our aduer≈øariesfal≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øpred vpon vs. For, immediatly
vpon the departure of Theodore Beza, a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure ranne, that he being conuycted
by the Cardinall of Lorayne, was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Catholikes (as they cal
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues) and agreed with them, as cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <pb facs="tcp:11319:14"/> the Sacrament
(as they terme it) of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aulter. Of thys tale, what was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couloure and
occa≈øion? I wyll ≈øhortly ≈øhew. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Beza, the day after hys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng, came
to the Queenes pre≈øence, in the palayce of the kyng of Nauarre, by whom he
was ≈øent for, there beeyng pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, the Prince of Conde, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of
Borbon &amp; diuers other, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of Lorayne emonges others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there, began to entreate and exhort him, to encline to peace and concorde,
≈øaying, that as being ab≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t he had trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the kyngdom, ≈øo now being
pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t he might wel appea≈øe it. Hereto, Beza, fir≈øt ≈øhewing, what good
wil he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes borne, to the kyng and hys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey: aun≈øwered,
that he was not of power, to trouble ≈øo great a king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome but muche le≈ø≈øe
of purpo≈øe to do it, whiche mighte well appeare by hys wrytinges, hopyng
al≈øo, that they ≈øhould perceyue greater proofe therof, in hys talke. Then
the Queene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of hys wrytynges. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon, the Cardenall takynge
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øyon, ≈øayd that he hadde a booke, publy≈øhed in the name of Beza, in
the <pb facs="tcp:11319:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> which he red one horrible inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>uen≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, Namely,
that Chri≈øt, is now ≈øo to be lought in his Supper, as afore he tooke vpon
hym our fle≈øh, and was borne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> virgin. I haue heard al≈øo, (quoth he)
that you wrote in a certaine booke, that Chri≈øt, is in ≈øuch ≈øort in his
Supper, as he is in a dunghil. With the≈øe ≈øayings, al tho≈øe that were
pre≈øent were greatly offended. But Beza ≈øayd. As for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, if they
were pre≈øent, I myght more certainly aun≈øwere, whether they were myne or
no. But as to the fir≈øt ≈øentence it may wel ≈øeeme vnrea≈øonable as it is
rehear≈øed of my Lorde Cardinal. But well vnder≈øtode, and tho≈øe thinges
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, which go afore it, and folowe it, we ≈øhal fynde it mo≈øt
true. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la≈øt is not onely ≈øhamefull, but wycked al≈øo, and
bla≈øphemous. And (I am well a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) can neyther be founde in my
wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, nor any others of our part. Ouer pa≈ø≈øing therfore this la≈øt,
(in the which, who≈øoeuer was the author of it, he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to playne and
manife≈øt a lie,) the Cardinall returned to the fir≈øt. It were very hard
(quod he) that we ≈øhould haue no more than tho≈øe olde fathers.
Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, <pb facs="tcp:11319:15"/> how could Chri≈øtes fle≈øhe be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, afore it
was? Then Beza a≈øked of the Cardinall, whether from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the
world, there had ben any Church? he graunted. Al≈øo, was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øame
Churche, a Church by him, which is the Mediatour betwixt God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>? There to
he agreed al≈øo. Is not Chri≈øt, the true God and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, the≈øame Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour?
He confe≈ø≈øed that al≈øo. Then (quod Beza) the communicating of the
fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with Chri≈øt, is not to be limited to y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> tyme, in the which in
dede, he ioined his diuinity to our nature. For, that which was not as yet, by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour≈øe of nature, was alwayes by power and effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent to the eyes
of our fayth. Is it not ≈øayd, that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øaw the day of Chri≈øt, and
reioyced? Al≈øo Paule ≈øayeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our fathers, did eate the ≈øelfe ≈øame
≈øpiritual foode, and dronke the ≈øelfe ≈øame ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drynke, out of
the ≈øpirituall rocke which folowed them, which rocke was Chri≈øt. Hereunto
the Cardinall agreed al≈øo and adioyned here to that which is written in the
Apocalips, that the lamb was ≈ølayne from the beginning of the world. Then
Beza entreated ≈øomwhat <pb facs="tcp:11319:16"/> of the difference of the olde and newe
Te≈øtament. From thys que≈øtion (as it haps many tymes) they fel into the
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoning, of the pre≈øence of the body of Chri≈øt in his ≈øupper. We do
not agree (quoth the Cardinal) in the expo≈øition of the≈øe wordes of our
Lord. This is my body. I graunt (quoth Beza) and I am ≈øory, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we agree no
better. But I had rather plainly to graunt it, than to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemble it. I
(quoth the Cardinall) doe teache the children of my dioce≈ø≈øe, when they are
a≈øked, what is the bread of the body of our Lord, to an≈øwere that it is the
body of Chri≈øt. Do ye di≈øalow that? No (quoth Beza). For it is the
≈øayinge of Chri≈øt. But, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> que≈øtion is, after what ≈øort, the bread is
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Chri≈øt. For, of tho≈øe thinges, which are ≈øayd to be,
all are not ≈øayd to be after one ≈øelfe ≈øame ≈øort. And there with, he
touched ≈øomewhat of the Sacramental maners of ≈øpeaking. Wherin the Cardinal
did not much repugne again≈øt the ≈øayings of Beza, onely again≈øt that
place (but the rocke is Chri≈øt) whiche Beza cyted, he ≈øet this. The worde
was made fle≈øh. But he was ≈øone made to leaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hold. <pb facs="tcp:11319:16"/> For
y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> which is ≈øpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, of a natural and e≈ø≈øential co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munion, far differeth
from the Sacramental ≈øpeach. At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> la≈øte this que≈øtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> (quoth Beza)
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øi≈øteth in foure pointes. The fir≈øt, is of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øignes. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing ≈øignifyed. The third, of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ioyning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øignes with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
thing ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The fourth, of the participation of the ≈øignes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi>
thinges ≈øignified by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. As to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fir≈øt (quoth he) we do not agree, that
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lords Supper, you do appoint onely accidentes in ≈øtede of the
≈øignes. Wheras we continue there, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of bread &amp; wine as both the
nature of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments requires, &amp; al≈øo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth.
Here, the Cardinal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting hym. Truly (quoth he) I thinke my ≈øelfe able
enough, to defende tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øub≈øtantiation. But, I thynk, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuines might
well inough haue left out y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Neyther would I, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poynt,
≈øhould re≈øt any diur≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of our churches. As to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øecond poynt,
(quoth Beza), we do not only ≈øay, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meryte of Chri≈øtes death &amp;
pa≈ø≈øion is ≈øignified vnto vs, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øignes of bread and wyne. But
al≈øo, the true body, that was crucified for vs, and the true bloud which was
≈øhed for vs <pb facs="tcp:11319:17"/> and to be ≈øhort, that Chri≈øt him≈øelf, true
God and man, is ≈øignified vnto vs, by the≈øe vi≈øible ≈øignes, that oure
myndes and vnder≈øtanding may by fayth ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually beholde hym in heauen,
where he now a≈øce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded, re≈øteth. And ≈øo, haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruition of all hys
goods and giftes to lyfe euerla≈øtyng. And that, a≈ø≈øone, and as ≈øurely,
as we ≈øee, take, eate &amp; drynke, tho≈øe corporall and vi≈øible ≈øignes.
The Cardinall agreed hereto, ≈øignifying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was glad to vnder≈øtande it.
For that he had heard afore that we taught other wy≈øe. As to the thirde
(quoth Beza) we graunt, that there is great difference betwixt common water;
&amp; it wherwith we are wa≈øhed in Bapti≈øme, betwixt breade and wyne whyche
we v≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, and tho≈øe which we receiue in the Lordes Supper. For the
water in Bapti≈øme, and bread and wyne in the Lordes Supper, be Sacramentes:
that is to wyt, vi≈øible ≈øignes and te≈øtimonies of the body and bloud of
our Lord. But this chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ge, we do not admit, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the elementes.
But in thys, that they are ≈øeuered to an other v≈øe, farre di≈øtant from
it, whereto naturally they <pb facs="tcp:11319:17"/> be appoynted. For whereas naturally,
they ≈øerue, to the nouri≈øhment of the bodye, when they become Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts,
they repre≈øent that, whiche ≈øpiritually fedeth and refre≈øheth our
≈øoules. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this ≈øacramentall chaunge, we attrybute, neither to
the Vertue of the worde, whiche any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, neither, to his purpo≈øe
&amp; intention (as they terme it) but to the power and vertue of god. Who≈øe
wil &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, is declared to vs by his worde. In that re≈øpect
therefore, that the thinge ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, is offered and geuen vnto vs of the
lord, and that, as trulye, as the ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof are geuen vnto vs, in that
re≈øpect, and no other, we acknowledge the coniunction of the ≈øignes, which
y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> thinge ≈øignified. And ≈øo al≈øo we ≈øaye, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body and bloud of
Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, in that they are truly geuen vs, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>municated vnto vs, to
be trulye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent al≈øo, in the v≈øe of his ≈øupper, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet is it
therfore to be ≈øayde, that that body, is ether vnder the bread, or in the
bread, or with the bread, or in any other place, than in heauen, to the whiche
Chri≈øt a≈øcended. Wher accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g <pb facs="tcp:11319:18"/> to his humane nature he
remaineth till he ≈øhal come to iudge the quick and the dead. Then the
Cardinall, once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne affirmynge, that he forced not Tran≈øub≈øtanciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
≈øayde: that Chri≈øt in deede, was to be ≈øought in heauen. Neuertheles he
mixed therwith, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the locall pre≈øence of Chri≈øte &amp; the
opinyon of certayn Germans ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And ≈øo confounded the≈øe matters
together, that it well appeared, he had not bin muche occupied in that article.
Which, he him ≈øelfe witne≈ø≈øed al≈øo, ≈øai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that he had ≈øpente the
mo≈øt part of his tyme, in other bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. I graunt ye (quoth Beza)
that we agre not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certayne of the Germans, in this third article. But in
this one thing, the grace of god is fauorable to vs al a like, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on
con≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, we condemne. Tran≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanciation, and what≈øoeuer dependeth
thereupon. And all alyke graunt and confe≈ø≈øe, the liuely communicating, of
the body and bloude of Chri≈øt. Grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t ye then (quoth the Cardinall) that we
in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øupper, do truely, and ≈øub≈øtanciallye Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>municate, with the body
&amp; bloude of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> remainth (quoth Beza) <pb facs="tcp:11319:18"/> For
the fourth poynte: We do ≈øaye in effect. That the vi≈øible ≈øygnes, which
naturally are eaten and dronken, are touched with our ≈øences, but the thing
≈øignified, namely, the body and bloud of Chri≈øt, truely, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any
coloure or deceit, is offered to al men, but can not otherwy≈øe be receiued
but ≈øpiritually, &amp; by fayth. For, thei be not receiued, with one hande or
mouth. Yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe, thys communicating is ≈øo certayn, that it,
which we ≈øee wyth our eyes, &amp; touche with our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> be no ≈øurer.
Although the mi≈øery of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp; of the ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue of the holy
gho≈øt, nether ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by ≈øence be perceiued, nor by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pa≈ø≈øe of oure
wit comprehended. The Cardinall affirmed that he was ≈øaty≈øfied wyth the≈øe
rea≈øons. And that openly te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed to the Queene. Geuing good hope that
there ≈øhoulde en≈øue ≈øome happye ende of thys conference. He entreated
al≈øo, and de≈øyred Beza, that he would oftener talke and conferre with him,
of the≈øe matters, that ≈øo at la≈øt, they myghte make ≈øome waye to peace
and concorde. So, tho≈øe that heard thereof, were in greate hope, of
<pb facs="tcp:11319:19"/> better ≈øucce≈ø≈øe. But therewithall, ≈øome came to the
Cardinall, willing hym to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinue in hys fir≈øt purpo≈øe, ea≈øely
≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which afterwards happened. For, the next day, there was a
rumour ≈øpred, not only in the court, but al≈øo in Poy≈ø≈øye, yea and
afterwardes, caryed into farre countreyes, that at the fyr≈øte meting, Beza
was ouercome, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Cardinals labour. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that
we had now taken the foyle. The≈øe, and diuers ≈øuche other tales, (as
cu≈øtome is,) were forged &amp; ≈øpred abrode, which, although they might be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>futed with the witne≈ø≈øe of many credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, yet now at la≈øt,
in tyme prouing them≈øelues lyes, to their great ≈øhame, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> fir≈øt fayned
them, are vani≈øhed awaye. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> as the tyme was thus prolonged and no an≈øwer
made vnto vs, we came to the nobles of the realm, and earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øyred
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that we myght be heard: Lea≈øt in ouerpa≈øting ≈øo mete an

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which
we fir≈øt propo≈øed, might be ob≈øerued, and that we myght not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:11319:19"/> couple w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our aduer≈øaries. But chefely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might not be
their owne iudges in the matter. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what≈øoeuer ≈øhuld happen, might
hereafter appeare more certain, we required an an≈øwere in writing. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
it was denied vnto vs, we came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene, de≈øiring and be≈øeching her,
to graunt to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtes. There wer pre≈øent, the king of Nauarre, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
prince of Conde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admiral, the Chancelour. The Queene an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Bi≈øhops ≈øhuld in no wi≈øe be our iudges. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, ≈øuch thigs as wer
done, one of the kinges ≈øecretaries, ≈øhuld re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øter (which was one of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, we call ≈øecrytaryes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>maundements.) And if we would our

But ≈øhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs, to do al thyngs moderatly and wi≈øely, re≈øpecting
onely the glory of God, of the aduauncement wherof, ≈øhe thought vs
de≈øyrous. But that the≈øe <pb facs="tcp:11319:20"/> thinges ≈øhould be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vnto vs in
wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, ≈øhe thougth it was not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente for many cau≈øes.
Neuerthele≈ø≈øe, ≈øhe promi≈øed we ≈øhoulde haue it, if we had nede

Fora≈ømuche as, if ≈øhe meante to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, her writing could not let her.
Immediatly after our departure, came the doctours of the Sorboni≈øtes,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring the Quene, that ≈øhe woulde not vouch≈øafe to heare vs. But if
≈øhe were determined to heare vs, at the lea≈øt, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not
≈øuffer the kyng to be pre≈øent therat. For that, it was great perill (as
they ≈øayd) lea≈øt the king in this his tender age, ≈øhoulde be
≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned wyth vn≈øounde doctrine, from the which afterwardes he ≈øhould
hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be withdrawen. And that we, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈ømuchas we were already condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of here≈øye, were not to be heard at all. Then the Queene aun≈øwered, that
≈øhe woulde doe nothing withoute her councell. Whereby they well perceiued,
that the matter was not likely to pa≈ø≈øe, as they wi≈øhed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, thoughe all oure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes <pb facs="tcp:11319:20"/> were not

tollerable, we thoughte it good, to take the occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lea≈øte we myghte
≈øeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte the conference. The next day therefore whiche was the
nynth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tember, we came to Poy≈ø≈øye, to the cloy≈øter of Nunnes, where
the king was, with his brother the Duke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaunce, the Quene, the king
&amp; Queene of Nauarre, and the re≈øt of the nobles, with the whole councel,
there were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent al≈øo, the Cardinalls, and Bi≈øhops, accompaynyed with
a great number of eccle≈øia≈øt call per≈øons. We mini≈øters, to the number
of xii. and .xx. of tho≈øe, whom other churches had ≈øente, came in afore
them. But, lea≈øt the people of the towne ≈øhoulde make any riot vpon vs, the
kinges garde brought vs from our lodginges to the Nunnery. A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoone as we
came to the kinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, and wer commaunded to ≈øpeake, Theodore Beza,
(which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuer≈øal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øent was appoynted therto) made an oratyon: in
the which, thankyng God and the Kynge, that nowe at the <pb facs="tcp:11319:21"/> la≈øt,
our cau≈øe ≈øhuld he heard, he ≈øhewed the cau≈øes for the which, we had
bin lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g before expelled, and vniu≈øtly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ned. Furthermore, in what
articles, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with our aduer≈øaries, in what others, and how we did
differ. And what was the meane, to appea≈øe all troubles and reforme religion.
Then in fewe wordes, he ≈øhewed the doctrine of oure fayth and Sacramentes,
and bryefelye touched the chiefe errours, that haue crept into religion, whiche
whyles he handeled grauely moderatly, and wyth ≈øynguler eloquence, he was
heard very diligently of al men, except when, he treated of the pre≈øence of
the body of Chri≈øt in his ≈øupper. For, when he ≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, how, we are made
partakers of hym in hys Supper, and taught the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øame to be done, by the power
of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gho≈øt, which conioyneth &amp; knitteth, thinges mo≈øt farre
di≈øtance in nature: and that Chri≈øt, could no otherwy≈øe be receiued, than
by fayth: and that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to de≈øcende from heauen, that we may
communicate of hys body: and that he is not enclo≈øed in the bread, but
remayneth in heauen, till he ≈øhall come <pb facs="tcp:11319:21"/> to iudge the world: or
rather that, as to that corporall pre≈øence, he is as far ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent from the
bread, as the hye≈øt heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, is di≈øtant from the lowe≈øt earth: the≈øe
thinges I ≈øay. Whiles he handeled, ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Bi≈øhops bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly to
grudge and murmure. Crying that he ≈øpake ≈øhameful bla≈øphemy. Some
hi≈ø≈øed, ≈øome ro≈øe, as though they would depart. And the Cardinall of
Turon ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly de≈øired, that either he might be licenced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, or we put
to ≈øile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce. They wer ≈øory that afore they could get no occa≈øion, to
interrupte our oration. And therfore, it pricked them at the heartes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
were ≈øo attentiuely heard. Neither is it to be doubted, but ether they would
haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, or els violently haue runn vpon vs, vnle≈ø≈øe the very
pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the king, had repre≈øt their fury. Silence
commaunded a new, Beza, gently de≈øired them, that they woulde quietly heare
what remained. So it myghte happen, that the matter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they them≈øelues
mighte be ≈øati≈øfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So he had licence to conclude. And not onely to
declare the re≈øydue of tho≈øe thinges, that pertayne to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb facs="tcp:11319:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> declaratyon of Chry≈øtes pre≈øence in his ≈øupper: but
al≈øo all ≈øuch thinges, as concerne the Eccle≈øia≈øticall di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne,
and the dutye and authoritye of officers. This oratyon ended, the Cardinall of
Turon perced with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, tremblyng, and freating, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øayled the king to
geue no credite to our wordes, nor ≈øwarue from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of his
aunce≈øters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that he mighte obtaine his de≈øire, he prayed the
gloryous virgine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and the ble≈ø≈øed Saintes. Then he de≈øired, to
haue a copy of our orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a daye appointed to aun≈øwere it. Saying,
that he hoped, that oure argumentes, and rea≈øons ≈øhoulde bee ≈øo fully
≈øati≈øfied, that if any parte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ≈øtucke in the kinges minde, it
≈øhoulde thereby, ea≈øely be rooted oute. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhoppes tooke
aduy≈øemente with the deuines and Canoni≈øtes, howe they mighte aun≈øwere
oure oration. But then the Cardinall of Lorayne, bra≈øte out into the≈øe
wordes. Would to God, that eyther he had ben dumme, or we deaffe.</p>
            <p>The matter long weyed emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ges them, <pb facs="tcp:11319:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> they
concluded, not to aun≈øwere all the poyntes of our oration, (either bicau≈øe
they would not, or could not) but .ii. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Fir≈øt, that whiche we ≈øayde
of the Churche and then that which was ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Lordes Supper.
Afterwards they de≈øired, that they might geue vp a common confe≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, in
wryting, ≈øub≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by euery of them. Which if the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters would not
allow, they myghte then procede with a ≈øolemne decree, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them. And
≈øo take away the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. From the whych polecy, the wy≈øe≈øt, and
graue≈øt men abhorring, ≈øharpely with≈øtode their purpo≈øe. In the meane
tyme, we determined, to make ≈øupplication to the kyng, that he woulde not
≈øuffer the conference thus to be broken of, nor the Bi≈øhops to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in their own cau≈øe. Saying, that we had not yet ≈øhewed, the proofes of oure
opynion, but onely ≈øymplye and playnly, hadde drawen the articles of oure
fayth which afterwardes, myght bee more largely handeled, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the
te≈øtimonies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if he did ≈øuffer the Bi≈øhops, to proocede
≈øo at theyr owne wyll <pb facs="tcp:11319:23"/> and decree their own cau≈øe, it woulde
come to pa≈ø≈øe, that both he ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, of hys good expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,
and al≈øo no remedy hereafter founde for ≈øuche troubles as do dayly growe.
This ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was geuen to the Chancelor, who by his prudence, prouided,
that the conference was not broken of, and that the Bi≈øhops kept, farre more
moderate and quiet order than they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The eight day after, which was the xvi. of the≈øame moneth, the
Cardinal of Loraine an≈øwered our oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øting afore, that he,
and his, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ≈øubmit them≈øelues, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges rule, and would be
ready, to obeye hys commaundement in al pointes: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe,
re≈øerued place, for theyr wonted immunitie and fredom, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they are wont
to quite them≈øelues from all ≈øubiection, and chalenge the chiefe
authoritie. And that he did ≈øo ≈øut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telly, that he ≈øcarcely ≈øemed, to
touche that ≈øore. And pretending a coloure of concorde, he prote≈øted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue vs, which had ≈øwarued from him, if we would returne,
&amp; humble our <pb facs="tcp:11319:23"/> ≈øelues to them. To conclude that they would
be, as fathers towards vs. If we would ≈øhew our ≈øelues, as children
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them. The≈øe, &amp; ≈øuch other like, afore promi≈øed, he ≈øayd
he would aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere onely to the Articles of our orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereof the one
concerned the Church, the other the Lordes Supper. He ymagined, that we had
≈øo defyned y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> Church, as though, the name thereof, had extended no farther,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to the elect: and therfore largely rea≈øoned agayn≈øte it, ≈øhewing out
of the common ≈øimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the go≈øpel, (in the whiche, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
to a plat of grounde, and to a fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhers net,) that the name therof, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
euen to ill and reprobate per≈øons. But he gaue it a meruaylous definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>:
Saying, that the Catholike Church is it, which is euery where knowen, and of
all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. To the authority of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> church, he ≈øayd, al interpretation of
Scriptures and making of traditions ought to bee referred. Saying that the
≈øucce≈ø≈øion, as well of that Church, as of the pa≈øtours therof, was
perpetual but of the Lordes Supper, he ≈øo entreated, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> touching no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at
al, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natures of <pb facs="tcp:11319:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> the elements, he came
very nye to their opinion, which ioyne the body &amp; bloud of Chri≈øt, with
the elementes. And ≈øay, that they be both vnder them, and in them. Which
afterwardes, we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtode, was done for a polecy, partly, to procure their
fauoure, whom he had ≈øo kindly clawed, and partly, to make vs the more
hatefull to them. Neither yet did he plainly agree with them, but ≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that in thys re≈øpect, he did willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyne with them, that they myghte
ioyntly warre again≈øt vs. The ende of his oration, was to this effect. That
the kyng and his coun≈øell, leauing our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ≈øhould folow the ≈øteppes
of theyr for fathers, and not leaue their accu≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med v≈øage. When he had
ended, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired that pre≈øently, whiles the memory therof was yet
fre≈øh, we might ≈øati≈øfye his obiections, and refute his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. For
we feared, lea≈øt after thys the Cardinals an≈øwere, we ≈øhould ≈øcarcely
haue lea≈øure or liberty afterwardes to ≈øpeake. Bicau≈øe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day afore,
many brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ≈øhuld loke for nothing els, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> condemnation, &amp;
the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>derbolt of exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Neyther wer we ignorant <pb facs="tcp:11319:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> therof. The Queene, taking the adui≈øe of her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cel, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>maunded vs
to depart, ≈øaying: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ≈øhould an≈øwere it an other tyme, &amp; that
≈øhe would appoint vs a day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> we ≈øhuld be pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t again. And ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
meruaile had it ben, if the by≈øhops, which wer of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cel, would haue
geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> any other councel. The next day againe we de≈øired y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be
pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly heard and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme no longer prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ged. But we could obtayne
nothing, neither wer we heard, before the eight day. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time, fal≈øe
rumors were ≈øpred abrode, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we wer ouercome, &amp; put to ≈øile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, &amp;
had nothyng to ≈øay. Whereas we were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to haue an≈øwered their oration
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently. And how fal≈øe ≈øuch tales be, here by men may ≈øufficiently
ge≈ø≈øe, that the Bi≈øhops did what they could, to breake of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ference,
≈øo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the la≈øt, by their importunity they obteined of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queene that
the matter ≈øhuld not be ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ly heard afore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, but in a more ≈øecret

at the whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>maunded to returne to Poy≈ø≈øye, we came before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quene,

wherby he hath limited his grace to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certayn ≈øea or countrey. Whiche in

de≈øtroyeth the churche, that he ≈øeemeth euen to roote it oute, and not to

nations and in the mo≈øt part of all the Ea≈øte. Otherwhere, as in Greece,
and other realmes more nie to vs, he hath lefte ≈øome tokens of the churche.
Agayne, ≈øometyme the Lorde dothe cut and breake of, onely the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonall
≈øucce≈ø≈øion of pa≈øtours: as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at Antioche, in the time of

further: the per≈øonall ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion, then at the lea≈øt fayled in the
Romaine churche, when Honorius be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bi≈øhop, was condemned for the

Iohn, the. xxii of that name, who was al≈øo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>demned for here≈øie.
Vnle≈ø≈øe perhaps ≈øome man wyll mayntayne, that tho≈øe that are
manife≈øtly condemned of here≈øye, be pa≈øtours. Furthermore in what ca≈øe
this ≈øucce≈ø≈øion ≈øtoode vnder Iohn the ≈øhee Pope, through the

haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to the purene≈ø≈øe of doctrine, and the ≈øincere

it was forthwith ≈øhewed, that therby is the confu≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, of the true
eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øticall order and ≈øtate, made muche more manife≈øt. For that

than by taking from them the liberty of choy≈øe which ≈øo long tyme, they had

ordaining Bi≈øhops, and pa≈øtours, it is right well knowen, what a ie≈øt it
is, and therefore we wyll wa≈øte no time in ≈øpeaking of it. For we entred
not into that matter, to handle it at large, but onely to ≈øhew that oure
myni≈øtery, which in thys ruine, and ≈øo great confu≈øion, of the church,
the Lord hath ray≈øed, is lawful, and vnworthely <pb facs="tcp:11319:60"/> mocked at. You
your ≈øelues began fir≈øt to talke thereof, (quoth the Cardinall) you fir≈øt
inuaded our flocke. We came not into your garri≈øons, but you into oures,
Neither would I wi≈øh you ≈øhuld thinke your ≈øelues as good as we, nor

               </gap>ies and craftes where with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tykes are wont to creepe
into mennes heartes, he applied to vs. Calling vs foxes, and dogges. And at the
la≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that we ought to be reiected, and referred, to the coun≈øel
of Trent, which the Pope of Rome had proclaymed, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that we ≈øhould
haue free comming thither, and the Popes ≈øafeconduyte, that there the
controuer≈øies of fayth &amp; religion ought to be iudged, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which,
weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, ≈øouldiors or other not exerci≈øed in diuine matters, were not mete to

her to ≈øend vs to Trent. Hitherto his talke, although it fauored bitter hate,
and malice, yet to ≈øome ≈øemed graue and ≈øeuere. But at y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> la≈øte, he
played the foole ≈øo kindly, as if it had ben in a ≈øtage. For when he
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes Supper, &amp; promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by a playne ≈øimilitude to
proue the pre≈øence therein, he ≈øayd it was euen lyke, as if any Prince,
when he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued victory on his enemies, to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the remembraunce
therof, would in≈øtitute yearly playes, whereby bothe his warre, and victory
might be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to al mennes eyes. And if any man in tho≈øe playes
≈øhoulde repre≈øente the per≈øon of the Prynce, That would ≈øo much the
more moue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> beholders, to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber it, but if y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> king
him≈øelf would be pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, &amp; ≈øhew hym≈øelfe there, then the≈øame
would be mo≈øt noble and excellent. Euen ≈øo ≈øayd he, that Chri≈øt
him≈øelfe, when he in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the remembraunce of his pa≈ø≈øion would
al≈øo be pre≈øent, and in the ≈øame. About the ende of hys oration he
a≈ø≈øai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enflame the Queene agayn≈øt vs, <pb facs="tcp:11319:63"/> and made many
mournfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plaintes faining him≈øelfe to wepe, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tho≈øe
ie≈øters, which ar common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apte to counterfayte any ge≈øture. Hereto Beza
aun≈øwered, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard talked, as though we were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conuict of
here≈øy. But for a≈ømuchas no man hitherto, hath ≈øhewed vs oure error, he
might haue done much better, if he had re≈øerued, the ≈øcoffes which he
be≈øtowed on vs, to hym≈øelfe and his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Bicau≈øe we can not ≈øe how
they touche vs. And as to his councel, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Queenes maie≈øtie was not ≈øo
bare of coun≈øell, that ≈øhe neded it. But that ≈øhe and her councell ≈øawe
well inough, what is be≈øt to be done, and by what meanes, they may prouide
for common quietne≈ø≈øe. But that which he ≈øayd of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes ≈øupper,
that he made nothing els of, than a play of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> hi≈øtory of Chri≈øt
(bicau≈øe it was to bla≈øphemous &amp; bea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) beyng ouerpa≈ø≈øed, he
turned toward ma≈øter Spen≈øa. He vrged the playne wordes of the Lord. Thys
is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the con≈øent of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>geli≈øtes, whiche nothing differ
therein. We aun≈øwered that the≈øame Euangeli≈øtes <pb facs="tcp:11319:63"/> ≈øayd,
thys is my bloud of the new te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And an other. Thys cup is the new
Te≈øtament, in my bloud. Whych without a figure can not be vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And hereby it appeareth, that it is a Sacramental maner of ≈øpeach. Which
Au≈øtine teacheth mo≈øt plainly in his .xxiii. Epi≈øtle to Boniface. If the
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes (quoth he) had not a certayne lykene≈ø≈øe, of tho≈øe thynges,
wherof thei are Sacramentes, they wer no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes at al. Of thys
lykene≈ø≈øe mo≈øte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>monly, they take the names of tho≈øe thyngs, wherof
they are Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts. Lyke as therfore, after a certayne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> Sacrament
of the body of Chri≈øt is the body of Chri≈øt, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>te of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
bloud of Chri≈øt, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of chri≈øt, ≈øo is al≈øo the Sacrament of
fayth, faith it ≈øelfe. But Spen≈øa ≈øayde that y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> letted not, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we
ought ≈øimply, &amp; without figure to credite the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord. We
≈øayd: that a Sacramentall maner of ≈øpeache, coulde not be withoute fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
But if there be a figure in our Sacramentes (quoth Spen≈øa) they ≈øhal not
then muche differ, from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes of the old Te≈øtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, which
<pb facs="tcp:11319:64"/> are altogether figuratine. And we ≈øay, that they were a figure
and ≈øhadowe of that truthe, which was fulfilled to vs in Chri≈øt.
Otherwi≈øe, we mu≈øt nedes confe≈ø≈øe, that they were figures of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Which is mo≈øt vnrea≈øonable, we denyed that con≈øequence, bicau≈øe y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi>
fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, appointed by God in the olde Te≈øtament, are referred to the truth
it ≈øelfe, wherof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers wer partakers, but a farre of, before the
commynge of Chri≈øt. But we are nye at hande. After he was offred for vs.
Neither do we ≈øay that we are as yet vnder figures, but y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> we nede yet, as
long as we lyue in this body, vi≈øible ≈øignes and Sacraments, and in them we
≈øay ther are figuratiue or Sacramentall maners of ≈øpeache, which

And ≈øuche lyke. Therein imitating Durand. Whom Gardyner al≈øo an open

that repugned wyth the nature of a Sacramente, fora≈ømuche as, if it lacke a

therefore repeating the≈øame continually, wyth great cryes, they cea≈ø≈øed
not after the maner of the Sorboni≈øtes, to babble til nyght. Yea and one of

maner, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it with oure brethren, and re≈øerue oure ≈øelues
libertye, either to adde or expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d any thinge therin, as we ≈øhould thinke
good.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinalles had ≈øene this forme, ≈øome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
allowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d it very well &amp; reioyced, as though we were tourned to them. And
diuer≈øe tales were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon ≈øprede of vs. But when it was peru≈øed by
the doctours as well Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boni≈øts, as others, they lightly chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ged their
opinion. They added therto ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (as we here ≈øay) their opynion, whereby
they ≈øhewed, what they thought wanted in it, or wherefore they thought it was
not to be allowed. Al≈øo, thei made almo≈øt a Tragedy, betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bi≈øhops,
and tho≈øe which had conferred with vs, and had put in y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> forme of this
agremente of this article, among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as thoughe they did either agree
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, or mocke with them. But bycau≈øe it is <pb facs="tcp:11319:68"/> no part of my
purpo≈øe, to writ their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. I will willingly leaue it. And now I
come to the declaration of oure opynion, as concernynge the pre≈øence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
body of Chri≈øt in his ≈øupper, which we re≈øerued, free to our ≈øelues,
lea≈øt any doubtfulnes, bycau≈øe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ≈øhortnes of our fyr≈øt writing,
myght breed any doubte or error.</p>
            <p>We affirme, that no di≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce of place may let our coniunction
with the body and bloude of Chri≈øt, bycau≈øe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes ≈øupper, is a
heauenly thinge. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought in the earthe, we receiue with the mouthe of
oure body, the breade &amp; wyne, the true Sacraments, &amp; ≈øygnes, of the
body and bloud of Chri≈øt: yet by fayth, &amp; the helpe of the holy gho≈øt,
our mindes to whom this foode doth chiefly belonge, caried vp to heauen, feede
on the pre≈øent body &amp; bloude. And in this re≈øpecte we ≈øaye al≈øo,
that the body is ioyned with the breade, and the bloude with the wyne. But no
other wy≈øe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øacramentally, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ≈øay, not accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g to place or
≈øituatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but bycau≈øe they do effectuou≈øly ≈øignify, y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> God giueth it
to tho≈øe that faythfullye communicate &amp; <pb facs="tcp:11319:68"/> they trulye receiue
it by faythe.</p>
            <p>Hereby it appereth in what ≈øorte we thinke, of the pre≈øence of
the bodye of Chri≈øt, in the V≈øe and Mini≈øtration of his Supper. For we
admytte, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tran≈øub≈øtantiation nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øub≈øtantiation. Yea we
refu≈øe all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pre≈øence, wherby Chri≈øtes body is thought to be in the
earth, without qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tity: or is affirmed to be any otherwher than in heauen. We
v≈øe the name of ≈øub≈øtaunce to ≈øignifye, that we meante not our fayth,
of anye fayned bodye or phanta≈øme, neyther of the vertue only of Chri≈øts
pa≈ø≈øion, or his merites only (which neuerthele≈ø≈øe, we confe≈ø≈øe to
be the ≈øpirituall catyng of Chri≈øtes fle≈øhe) but euen of the true and
natural bodye of the ≈øonne of God, which he toke of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> virgin Mary, and
afterwards was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and rai≈øed again for vs, and now re≈øteth in
heauen, till ≈øuche tyme as yt ≈øhal com to iudge the quick &amp; the
dead.</p>
            <p>And this was the ende of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For they that conferred
with vs beyng yll intreated of theyre fellowes, came not agayne. Neyther were
anye other cho≈øen in theyr roomes. Neyther <pb facs="tcp:11319:69"/> ≈øince that tyme,
dyd the Bi≈øhoppes ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefy any thing vnto vs, but though we oftentimes
de≈øired, that we myght goe forwardes, &amp; handle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re≈øt, that wer yet
vntouched, we could vnder≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g of their mindes therin, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they
min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to depart, &amp; wer de≈øirous to referre all thinges, to the councell
of Trente. Therefore, ordre being taken for the leauiyng of a ≈øub≈øedy
(wherof perhaps they were more careful, than of anye thing els,) &amp;
deliuering vp to the King the articles, whereof they had agreed among
them≈øelues, not making anye accompte of vs, but leauing vs in the court, they
al repaired to their homes.</p>
